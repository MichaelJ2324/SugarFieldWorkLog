SugarCRM Custom Field - Worklog (v0.7)

By Jon Whitcraft - Lead Internal Applications Engineer SugarCRM
---------------------------------

How To Use:
If you are adding a new field add a textarea field and then add the following lines to a file in custom/Extension/modules/<module name>/Ext/Vardefs/<some creative name>.php

```php
<?php

$dictionary['Bug']['fields']['work_log']['type'] = 'worklog';
$dictionary['Bug']['fields']['work_log']['dbType'] = 'text';

```

You can also convert a current textarea field to a worklog field by adding the above code to a file.

Issues to fix:
- Not Saving the new field
- Not showing the correct form in the Module Builder
